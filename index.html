        <p>Sophie Obayashi is an aspiring programmer living in the San Francisco Bay Area.  
          She recently moved here from NYC where she was working at a french bakery. She is a recent Oberlin College 
          graduate with a Bachelorâ€™s of Arts in Neuroscience and a minor in Creative Writing. </p>
      <p>Sophie is attending the UC Berkeley Coding Boot Camp where she will be developing 
          her programming skills for the next three months. After completion of this course, 
          she hopes to use and build on her knowledge of programming in a way that overlaps 
          with promoting scientific research. She is also interested in working as a web developer 
          for organizations that promote and boost visibility of the Asian American Diaspora.</p>
          <p>Some other things Sophie likes include: hiking, memes, neuroscience, poetry, 
            dark stout and german beers, and her dog. She also likes snowboarding and, largely related, the idea of not having a broken wrist anymore.</p><br>
